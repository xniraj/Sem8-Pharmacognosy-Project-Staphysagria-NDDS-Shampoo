### **Introduction**  
This repository documents the research and development of an innovative **Staphysagria-enriched phytosomal shampoo** designed to treat dandruff and scalp infections. The project integrates *Novel Drug Delivery Systems (NDDS)* to enhance the bioavailability and stability of Staphysagria (from *Delphinium staphysagria* seeds), a traditional herb with proven antimicrobial properties.  

### **Project Highlights**  
- **Objective**: Develop a natural, safe, and effective herbal shampoo to replace synthetic alternatives.  
- **Key Innovations**:  
  - **Phytosomal encapsulation** of Staphysagria extract for improved scalp penetration and stability.  
  - **Antimicrobial efficacy** against *Candida albicans* and *Staphylococcus aureus*.  
  - **Eco-friendly formulation** with hibiscus extract, coconut oil, and lemongrass fragrance.  
- **Results**:  
  - **89.7% entrapment efficiency** and **86.31% drug release** at 24 hours.  
  - Superior antifungal/antibacterial activity compared to ketoconazole and selenium sulfide.  
  - **pH 5.5–6.5**, **foam stability >15 mins**, and **no skin irritation**.  

### **Files Included**  
1. **[Sem-8-Oral-Presentation.pptx](Sem-8-Oral-Presentation.pdf)**  
   - Detailed presentation of methodology, experimental results, and conclusions.  
2. **[Sem-8-Poster-Presentation.pdf](Sem-8-Poster-Presentation.pdf)**  
   - Visual summary of the project, including workflow, key findings, and references.  

### **Technologies & Methods**  
- **Phytosome Preparation**: Solvent injection technique.  
- **Analytical Tools**:  
  - **TLC/HPLC/UV-Vis** for standardization.  
  - **FT-IR** for functional group analysis.  
  - **Zeta potential & SEM** for particle characterization.  
- **Antimicrobial Assays**: Agar well diffusion method.  
- **Stability Testing**: ICH guidelines (30±2°C, 65±5% RH).  

### **Key Outcomes**  
1. **Enhanced Bioavailability**: Phytosomes improved drug absorption and stability.  
2. **Superior Antimicrobial Activity**: Larger inhibition zones than synthetic standards.  
3. **Scalp Safety**: No irritation, ideal pH, and natural ingredients.
